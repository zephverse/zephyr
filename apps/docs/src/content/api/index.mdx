description: Where to find server APIs, types, and generated clients.

## Overview

Server logic lives primarily in `apps/web` and `apps/auth`, with shared types and clients in `packages/` (notably `@zephyr/db` and `@zephyr/auth`).

## Database access

Use Prisma clients exported from `@zephyr/db` for data access. Keep queries and mutations typeâ€‘safe and colocated with features.

## Validation

Use `zod` schemas and shared validators to ensure input safety across boundaries.
