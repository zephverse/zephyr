## Build & Development

### Turborepo Pipeline

`turbo.json` defines task dependencies:

```json
{
  "pipeline": {
    "build": {
      "dependsOn": ["^build"],
      "outputs": [".next/**", "dist/**"]
    },
    "dev": {
      "dependsOn": ["^dev"],
      "cache": false,
      "persistent": true,
      "env": ["NODE_ENV"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Commands:**

```bash
bun dev            # Start all apps in parallel
bun dev --filter=web  # Only web app
bun build          # Build all apps
bun lint           # Lint all packages
```

### Package Manager

Zephyr uses **Bun** for fast installs and script execution.

**Workspace config** (`package.json`):

```json
{
  "workspaces": ["apps/*", "packages/*"]
}
```

Dependencies are hoisted to the root `node_modules/`, but each package has its own `package.json`.
