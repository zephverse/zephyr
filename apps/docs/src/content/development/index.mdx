import { Callout } from "nextra/components";

## Run everything

```bash
# from repo root
bun install
bun run env:dev
bun run db:up
bun run dev
```

This starts `web`, `auth`, and `docs` concurrently.

## Useful scripts

- Lint/format: `npx ultracite check` or `npx ultracite fix`
- Type check & build: `bun run build`
- Clean artifacts: `bun run clean`
- Docker (infra): `bun run docker:dev`
- Docker (apps): `bun run docker:apps`

## Making changes

- Follow the Code style and A11y rules in the Contribution section
- Prefer shared logic in `packages/` and compose in `apps/`
- Keep components small, strongly typed, and accessible

When adding new dependencies in packages, ensure consumers list them as peer or workspace deps appropriately.
