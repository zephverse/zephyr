## App env files

- `apps/web/.env` — web app configuration (auth, storage, db URLs)
- `apps/auth/.env` — auth service configuration

Use `bun run env:dev` to copy example files, then fill sensitive values locally.

## Database & services

Postgres, Redis, and Meilisearch are used. For Docker, `bun run docker:dev` provisions containers; for native, ensure your local services match the example configuration.

## Secrets

Never commit secrets. Follow least privilege and rotate frequently.
