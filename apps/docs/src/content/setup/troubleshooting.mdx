## Ports in use

Stop local services or adjust ports for apps if 3000/3001/3002 are busy.

## Prisma client not generated

Run `bun run db:up` from repo root. Ensure Bun and Prisma are installed.

## Docker not starting

Run `bun run docker:clean` then `bun run docker:dev`. Check Docker Desktop logs.

## Type errors or lint failures

Run `bun run build` to surface issues, or `npx ultracite check` to lint.
