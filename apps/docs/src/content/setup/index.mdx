## Two ways to run locally

- Native (recommended): Bun + local tooling
- Docker: Containers for Postgres, Redis, Meilisearch, and apps

## Quick start (native)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zephverse/zephyr.git
cd zephyr
bun install
bun run env:dev
bun run db:up
bun run dev
```

## Quick start (Docker)

```bash
# infra
bun run docker:dev

# apps (web, auth, docs)
bun run docker:apps
```

If ports are busy, stop local services or change ports in app scripts.
