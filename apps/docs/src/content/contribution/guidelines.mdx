## Principles

- Accessibility first — comply with a11y rules across UI and interactions
- Type safety — prefer explicit types and exhaustive checks
- Small PRs — easier to review, test, and roll back
- Tests and docs — keep behavior and usage clear

## Commit messages

Follow conventional commits where possible. Use Changesets for versioning when publishing packages.

## Security

Never commit secrets. Avoid introducing unsafe APIs or broad permissions.
