# Issue Templates

Good issues help maintainers understand problems quickly and provide effective solutions. This guide explains how to create helpful issues.

> **Friendly reminder:** A well-written issue is like a gift to the maintainers! The more context you provide, the faster we can help you. Plus, you might discover the solution yourself while writing it up - happens more often than you'd think! 🎁

## Before Creating an Issue

### 1. **Search Existing Issues**
- Check if your issue already exists
- Look through [open issues](https://github.com/zephverse/zephyr/issues)
- Check [closed issues](https://github.com/zephverse/zephyr/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) too
- Search for similar problems or features

*We know, searching isn't the most exciting part. But finding an existing issue (with maybe even a solution!) is way faster than starting from scratch!*

### 2. **Verify It's Actually a Bug**
- Check the documentation
- Verify your setup matches requirements
- Try with a clean installation
- Test in a different environment

### 3. **Gather Information**
- Steps to reproduce
- Screenshots or recordings
- Error messages and logs
- System information
- Version numbers

## Issue Types

Zephyr uses GitHub issue templates. Choose the appropriate one:

### Bug Report

POST /api/upload/avatar 413 Payload Too Large
\`\`\`
```

## Feature Request Template

When requesting a feature:

### Problem Statement

What problem does this solve?

```markdown
**Is your feature request related to a problem?**
I'm always frustrated when I have to manually check multiple social platforms 
for new content. I want to receive notifications when new posts matching my 
interests are published.
```

### Proposed Solution

How would you solve it?

```markdown
**Describe the solution you'd like**
Add a notification system that:
- Allows users to set up custom content filters
- Sends browser/email notifications for matching posts
- Provides a centralized notification center
- Supports notification preferences (frequency, channels)
```

### Alternatives Considered

What other solutions did you think about?

```markdown
**Describe alternatives you've considered**
1. RSS feed integration - but requires external RSS reader
2. Email digest - but less real-time
3. Third-party notification services - but adds complexity
```

### Use Cases

Who benefits and how?

```markdown
**Use Cases**
- Power users who follow many topics
- Content creators monitoring their niche
- Community managers tracking discussions
- Users who want passive content discovery
```

### Additional Context

Mockups, examples, etc:

```markdown
**Additional context**

```

## Improvement Request Template

When suggesting improvements:

### Current Behavior

How does it work now?

```markdown
**Current behavior**
The search function only searches post content and hashtags. 
Results are displayed in chronological order.
```

### Proposed Improvement

What should change?

```markdown
**Proposed improvement**
Enhance search to:
- Search usernames, post content, hashtags, and comments
- Rank results by relevance (not just chronological)
- Add filters (date range, author, content type)
- Show search suggestions while typing
```

### Benefits

Why is this better?

```markdown
**Benefits**
- Users find relevant content faster
- Reduces frustration with current search limitations
- Improves content discoverability
- Better matches user expectations from other platforms
```

### Potential Drawbacks

Any concerns?

```markdown
**Potential drawbacks**
- Search indexing may increase database load
- Relevance ranking algorithm adds complexity
- May need to implement search service (Meilisearch)
```

Only affects PNG files > 5MB. JPG files up to 8MB work correctly.
```

### Example Feature Request

**Title:** Add customizable content filters and notifications

```markdown
**Is your feature request related to a problem?**
Users currently have to manually check multiple platforms and Zephyr 
to see new content matching their interests.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Implement a notification system with:
- Custom content filters (keywords, topics, users)
- Browser push notifications
- Email digests (daily/weekly)
- In-app notification center
- Notification preferences panel

**Describe alternatives considered**
1. RSS feeds - requires external reader
2. Email-only - less timely
3. Third-party integrations - adds complexity

**Use cases**
- Power users following many topics
- Content creators monitoring their niche
- Community managers tracking discussions

**Additional context**
Similar to Twitter's custom notifications and Reddit's topic alerts.
```

## What Not to Do

*Look, we get it - when something's broken or you really want a feature, it's tempting to cut corners. But trust us, these anti-patterns make things harder for everyone (including you!). Let's keep things friendly and productive!* 😊

### Don't

- ❌ Open duplicate issues (search first!)
- ❌ Hijack existing issues with unrelated topics
- ❌ Demand immediate fixes
- ❌ Use issues for support questions (use Discussions)
- ❌ Post vague issues without details
- ❌ Include sensitive information (passwords, keys)
- ❌ Be rude or disrespectful

### Do

- ✅ Search before creating
- ✅ Provide complete information
- ✅ Be patient and respectful
- ✅ Update issue with new findings
- ✅ Close issue if resolved
- ✅ Thank maintainers for their time

## After Creating an Issue

1. **Monitor for responses** - check back for questions
2. **Provide additional info** - if requested
3. **Test proposed fixes** - help verify solutions
4. **Close if resolved** - don't leave stale issues open
5. **Consider contributing** - maybe you can fix it!

> **Plot twist:** Sometimes writing a detailed issue helps you understand the problem well enough to fix it yourself! If you feel inspired to turn your issue into a PR, we'd absolutely love that. Every contributor started somewhere! 🌟
