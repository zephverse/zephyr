# Contributing to Zephyr

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **Zephyr**! We're excited to have you join our community. Zephyr is an open-source social platform built with modern web technologies, and we welcome contributions from developers of all skill levels.

> **First time contributing to open source?** Don't worry! Everyone starts somewhere. We're here to help you learn and grow. Check out our [First Contribution](/contribution/first-contribution) guide - it's like having a friendly mentor walk you through everything step-by-step.

## Quick Start

New to Zephyr? Start here:

1. **Read this guide** to understand our contribution workflow
2. **Check out [First Contribution](/contribution/first-contribution)** for a beginner-friendly setup guide
3. **Browse [open issues](https://github.com/zephverse/zephyr/issues)** to find something to work on
4. **Join the discussion** in issues or draft PRs before starting major work

## Contribution Workflow

Here's the standard flow for contributing to Zephyr:

### 1. **Discuss First** (for non-trivial changes)
   - Open an issue or comment on an existing one
   - Describe the problem you're solving or feature you're adding
   - Wait for feedback from maintainers before investing significant time
   - For small fixes (typos, bugs), you can skip straight to a PR

### 2. **Fork & Branch**
   - Fork the repository to your GitHub account
   - Clone your fork locally: `git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/zephyr`
   - Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
   - See [Branching Strategy](/contribution/branching-strategy) for naming conventions

### 3. **Develop & Test**
   - Follow our [Code Style](/contribution/code-style) guidelines
   - Write or update tests for your changes
   - Update documentation if you're changing functionality
   - Run the development server: `bun run dev`

### 4. **Quality Checks**
   - Format and lint your code: `bun run check`
   - Ensure all tests pass
   - Build the project to verify: `bun run build`
   - The pre-commit hook will automatically format staged files

### 5. **Commit Changes**
   - Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)
   - Use [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) for package versioning: `bun changeset add`
   - Write clear, descriptive commit messages
   - See [Guidelines](/contribution/guidelines) for commit conventions

### 6. **Submit Pull Request**
   - Push your branch: `git push origin feature/your-feature-name`
   - Open a PR against the `main` branch
   - Fill out the PR template completely
   - Link related issues using keywords (e.g., "Closes #123")
   - Request review from maintainers

### 7. **Review & Iterate**
   - Respond to reviewer feedback promptly
   - Make requested changes and push updates
   - Keep your PR up-to-date with `main` via rebase
   - See [Review Process](/contribution/review-process) for details

> **Pro tip:** Code reviews aren't about finding fault - they're about making great code even better! Every piece of feedback is a chance to learn something new. We've all been on both sides of this process, and we're all here to help each other improve. üöÄ

## What Can You Contribute?

Wondering how you can help? There are so many ways to make Zephyr better - and yes, that includes you! Here's the fun part: you don't need to be a coding wizard to contribute. 

- **Bug fixes**: Found a bug? Fix it and submit a PR *(Bug hunting is basically detective work, and who doesn't love solving mysteries?)*
- **Features**: Add new features (discuss first via issues) *(Got a cool idea? We'd love to hear it!)*
- **Documentation**: Improve docs, add examples, fix typos *(Found a typo? You're already helping! Documentation is SO important)*
- **UI/UX**: Enhance the user interface and experience *(Make things prettier and easier to use - design lovers welcome!)*
- **Accessibility**: Improve a11y compliance *(Help make Zephyr accessible to everyone - this is super meaningful work)*
- **Tests**: Add or improve test coverage *(Tests = confidence. Plus, writing good tests is oddly satisfying)*
- **Refactoring**: Improve code quality and maintainability *(Love clean code? Come join the cleanup crew!)*
- **Translations**: Help translate Zephyr (coming soon) *(Speak multiple languages? You're going to be invaluable when we launch this!)*

## License

Zephyr is licensed under [AGPL-3.0](https://github.com/zephverse/zephyr/blob/main/LICENSE). By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the same license.

**Key implications of AGPL-3.0:**
- Any modifications must be open-sourced
- If you run a modified version on a server, you must make the source available to users
- All derivative works must also be AGPL-3.0

> **Why AGPL-3.0?** We chose this license because we believe in keeping social platforms truly open. If someone builds on Zephyr, their improvements should benefit everyone in the community. It's about building together! ü§ù

## Getting Help

Stuck? Confused? Have questions? **That's totally normal!** We've all been there, and we're here to help:

- **Questions?** Open a [discussion](https://github.com/zephverse/zephyr/discussions) or [issue](https://github.com/zephverse/zephyr/issues) - no question is too small!
- **Stuck?** Check our [troubleshooting guide](https://github.com/zephverse/zephyr#-troubleshooting) - we've documented the most common hiccups
- **Need setup help?** See our [development setup guide](https://github.com/zephverse/zephyr#-local-development-setup) - step-by-step instructions included

*Remember: Every expert was once a beginner who refused to give up. You've got this!*

## Thank You

Every contribution, no matter how small, makes Zephyr better. We appreciate your time and effort in helping us build an amazing open-source social platform!

**Seriously though** - whether you're fixing a typo, submitting your first PR, or architecting a major feature, you're helping build something meaningful. The open-source community thrives because of people like you who choose to contribute their time and skills. Thank you for being awesome! üíô
