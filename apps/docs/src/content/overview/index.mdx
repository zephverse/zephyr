## What is Zephyr?

Zephyr is a fast, type‑safe social platform and content aggregator. It enables users to share content from external sources (currently HackerNews), create rich posts with media attachments, engage through comments and voting, and build reputation through the Aura system.

## Technical Pillars

| Pillar | Technologies & Approach |
|--------|------------------------|
| **Performance** | Bun + Turborepo + Next.js 15 with Turbopack for subsecond build times and optimal runtime performance |
| **Type Safety** | End‑to‑end TypeScript with strict configuration, Zod validation, and Prisma-generated types |
| **Accessibility** | A11y rules enforced via Ultracite (Biome-powered) linter and React best practices |
| **Developer Experience** | Clear npm scripts, Docker Compose for local development, and comprehensive documentation |
| **Scalability** | Redis caching, Meilisearch for fast search, MinIO for object storage, and PostgreSQL for data persistence |
