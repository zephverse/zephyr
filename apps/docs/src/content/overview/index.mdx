## What is Zephyr?

Zephyr is a fast, privacy‑first social platform built with a modern, type‑safe stack. It aggregates content, enables rich posting and discussion, and is designed for extensibility and contributor friendliness.

## Key pillars

- Performance: Bun + Turborepo + Next.js app router for subsecond UX.
- Type safety: End‑to‑end TypeScript with strict config and rich validation.
- Accessibility: A11y rules enforced via Ultracite and best practices.
- Developer experience: Clear scripts, batteries‑included local/dev/docker flows.

<Callout type="info">
This docs site focuses on the contributor experience: how to set up, develop, and make high‑quality changes safely and quickly.
