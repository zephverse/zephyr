## What is Zephyr?

Zephyr is a social networking platform that unifies the best parts of today’s apps into a single, fast experience. You can bring posts from other platforms, add your own public commentary, join topic‑driven communities, make friends, and message people, all without juggling multiple apps and feeds.

At its core, Zephyr is an aggregator: it pulls together content and conversations so you can focus on ideas, people, and communities instead of platforms.

## Key capabilities

- **Unified feed and sharing**: Aggregate posts from across the web into a clean feed and share them with your own public take, preserving clear attribution to the original.
- **Communities and relationships**: Join topic‑driven spaces, follow and befriend people you care about, and shape a feed that stays relevant, constructive, and human.
- **Messaging and collaboration**: Move seamlessly between your feed, direct messages, and small group chats; share media and links without breaking the conversation flow.
- **Curation and openness**: Save and organize links, media, and threads for later, and contribute to an open‑source project that welcomes community improvement.

<Callout type="info">
Zephyr includes an evolving reputation system called <strong>Aura</strong> that rewards meaningful participation, trust, and positive impact over time.

## How aggregation works

Zephyr consolidates what matters to you:

- **Bring content in**: reference posts, links, and media from other platforms so you can follow ideas and not apps.
- **Add context and discuss**: quote with your perspective to spark conversation, then continue the thread in replies, communities, and DMs with attribution intact.

This keeps the conversation in one place, while preserving clear attribution to the original source.

## Communities and connections

Communities are topic‑driven spaces where members share posts, ask questions, and collaborate. Follow people you care about, make friends, and build circles that keep your feed relevant and positive.

## Messaging that feels natural

Message friends directly or spin up communities for quick collaboration. Conversations stay fast and easy to follow, so you can move between your feed and DMs without friction.

## Zeph AI (WIP)

</Callout>

Zeph AI is a context‑aware assistant that helps you:

- **Context and summarization**: condense long threads and linked posts into structured takeaways that preserve source attribution, highlight key arguments and counterpoints, and surface open questions worth discussing.
- **Creation and guidance**: draft posts and replies from your notes, refine tone/length/clarity, and generate outlines, titles, and suggested replies, always editable and aligned to your voice.
- **Safety and control**: opt‑in context usage with clear controls, no auto‑posting, and citations when content is derived from external sources; per‑conversation memory that you can reset anytime.

## Aura: meaningful reputation

<Callout type="info">
Aura is designed with community input. Details and specification will evolve in public.
</Callout>

Aura reflects participation quality over time and not just raw activity.

- **What it measures**: originality, helpfulness, civility, and signal‑to‑noise; community feedback and acknowledgment; and healthy patterns like diverse sources and respectful debate.
- **How to earn and maintain**: share well‑sourced posts with your perspective, participate constructively in threads, and help others discover context; Aura decays slowly with inactivity and recovers through consistent quality.
- **Where it’s used**: improves discoverability, unlocks community roles and trust‑gated actions, and reduces friction in moderation — never gating core social features.
- **Fairness and transparency**: public methodology that evolves in the open with anti‑gaming checks, clear appeals, and community input.

## Why Zephyr

- **Privacy‑first, respectful design**: thoughtful defaults and controls that put you, not engagement metrics, at the center.
- **Fast, reliable foundation**: a real‑time, type‑safe stack that scales cleanly from individuals to communities.
- **One place for the web’s conversation**: follow, share, discuss, and build reputation without juggling multiple apps.

If you want social networking that is fast, focused, and future‑ready - Zephyr is built for you.
