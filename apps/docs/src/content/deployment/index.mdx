## Overview

Zephyr is split into multiple apps and packages. Typical deployment involves:

- Building `apps/web` and `apps/auth`
- Applying Prisma migrations and provisioning Redis & Meilisearch
- Providing production env vars for each app

## Tips

- Use `bun run build` at repo root to build with turborepo
- Ensure `@zephyr/ui` and other workspace deps are available in your environment
